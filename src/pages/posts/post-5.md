O R TWO CENTURIES, London’s buildings
were black. Blanketed in sulphurous soot from coal fi res – the famous
London “pea souper” fogs – a thin layer of carbon coated every surface
in the city. London was so dirty that there was no memory that it might
ever have been any other way. During the restoration of 10 Downing
Street in 1954 , it was discovered that the familiar dark facade was
not actually black at all, but originally yellow brick. The shock was
considered too much for the country to take and the newly clean building
was painted black to maintain its previous, familiar appearance.
But then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a great cleanup.
For more than a decade, scaff olding surrounded landmarks like
St Paul’s Cathedral, as power washers hosed the grime down into
the sewers and out of sight. These days the city is russet and pale
grey, silver-mirrored and blue green – the colours of brick , lime stone
and glass. The pollution is now polychrome: the primary residue
adhering to buildings is not the black of carbon soot, but a warmer
browny-yellow colour from the organic hydrocarbons in petrol and
diesel fuel. As sulphate emissions from traffi c fall, buildings may yet
turn green as mosses and lichens grow back.

Yet you can not just blast dust and grime off all of London’s
landmarks. Westminster Hall is the oldest building in parliament,
built about 900 years ago by William Rufus, son of the Norman conqueror.
In 2007, architectural conservators found that its walls were
being corroded by air pollution and penetrated by moisture. They
reckoned it had n ot been cleaned in 200 years. It was time.
But how to do this while maintaining respect for the building’s
fabric? Limestone is porous, soluble stuff , which could dissolve under
strain from high-pressure washing. Fortunately, more subtle methods
are available. Delicate carving can be cleaned using poulticing , akin
to a clay face mask for the stone, which draws out deep-seated salts
and staining. Latex fi lms are another option: they are brushed or
sprayed on, then left to absorb grime from the stone, before being
peeled off , taking the dirt with them.

News of the epic cleaning project at Westminster reached an
artist in New York, who got permission to preserve the latex sheets
used to clean the stonework. The artist, Jorge Otero-Pailos , subsequently
displayed them in an exhibition called The Ethics of Dust.
In June 2016, I walked into Westminster Hall and confronted a translucent,
glowing curtain, 50 metres long and fi ve metres tall, hung
from the ancient hammerbeam roof, a patchwork skin encrusted in
the grime of the entire city.
Since modernity began, people have complained about airborne
dust – but the measures required to control it have come decades or
centuries after, if at all. The coalmines and factories that powered
Britain’s Industrial Revolution made a capitalist class very rich, while
the cost was borne by their workers in their bodies, lungs and blood.
The Ethics of Dust was, for me, about human presence made present
– about the building rewritten as not only limestone and glass and a
wood-beamed roof, or as big abstract nouns like history and tradition
and power , but the material traces of millions of bodies, their
labours and their livelihoods. It brings the polis, the people, right into
the heart of parliament – and it brings a reckoning with the source of
Britain’s historical prosperity, too.
Nobody normally thinks about dust, what it might be doing or
where it should go: it is so tiny, so totally, absolutely, mundane, that
it slips beneath the limits of vision. But if we pay attention, we can
see the world within it.
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, I should defi ne my terms. What
do I mean by dust? I want to say everything : almost everything can
become dust, given time. The orange haze in the sky over Europe in
the spring, the pale fur that accumulates on my writing desk and the
black grime I wipe from my face in the evening after a day traversing
the city. Dust gains its identity not from a singular material origin,
but instead through its form (tiny solid particles), its mode of transport
(airborne) and, perhaps, a certain loss of context, an inherent
formlessness . If we knew precisely what it was made of, we might
not call it dust, but instead dander or cement or pollen. “Tiny fl ying
particles,” though, might suffi ce as a practical starting defi nition.
In 2015, I found myself driving into a forest fi re in the Sierra national
park in California. Smoke hung heavy in the sky: the fi re behind the
hills was one ridge away. The particles in the smoke cloud were the
soot and wood ash from a burning pine forest. Today, 8.5m tonnes
of this burnt “black carbon” are emitted around the world each year,
most not of natural origin, but instead from diesel engines, woodfuelled
cooking stoves and burning to clear land for agriculture. Black
carbon is a powerful “climate forcer”, absorbing warmth from the
sun and contributing substantially to global heating. It is also a major
component of fi ne particle air pollution, known as PM2.5s (particles
under 2.5 micrometres in size).
These tiny particles are easily inhaled deep into the lungs. Their
even-smaller cousins, ultrafi ne PM0.1s, can pass through the air sacs
in the lungs into the bloodstream, where they can be transported to
every organ and can harm potentially every cell in the human body.
Particulate air pollution causes not just respiratory illnesses but
heart disease, cancers, infertility, even neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s. Altogether, it’s the fi fth biggest cause of death
in the world, accounting for 4.2m lives lost each year. If London’s air
was compliant with World Health Organiz ation (WHO) standards for
PM2.5s, its residents would gain on average an extra 2.5 months of life.
In Lewisham, south-east London, a young girl named Ella Kissi-
Debrah lived with her mother, Rosamund, just 25 metres from the
city’s busy South C ircular Road. In 2010, aged seven, Ella started to
develop a strange and persistent cough. In February 2013, the nineyear-
old died of respiratory failure. For years, Rosamund fought to
expose the real cause of her daughter’s death. Finally, in December
2020, Ella made legal history as the fi rst person in the UK to have air
pollution listed as a cause of death. In his remarks, coroner Philip
Barlow said there is “no safe level of particulate matter” in the air
and called for national pollution limits to be reduced.
Urban dust is much more than simply carbon soot from combustion,
though: there’s friction between people and the environment at every
turn. On cars, buses and trains, brakes rub against tyres and tyres
press against roads and rails many millions of times a day, stressing
materials and abrading tiny pieces of metal and rubber and asphalt as
they go. This is dust I’m all too intimately familiar with: as a cyclist,
I know it as “road grime” .
